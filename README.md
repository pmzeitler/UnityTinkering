# UnityTinkering

This repository holds the code for my learning-experience project in Unity. I will be working in a 2D environment, looking to learn the fundamentals of the Unity framework and engine, and eventually creating the foundation of a 2D action-RPG in the style of Secret of Mana.

This code is provided under the MIT license but honestly it's slap-dash and not at all commented or organized. Use if you dare.
